            JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language.
            Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its
            environment to provide programmatic control over them.
        </p>
        <p>
            JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language
            elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a
            variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its
                Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements
                on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on
                a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database,
                provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file
                manipulations on a server.

            JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript
            language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows
            most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why
            it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
            In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime
            system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript
            has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based
            model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript
            also supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of
            objects, executing as loosely typed methods.

            JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables, classes,
            and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and you
            do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly
            typed.

        </header>
        <p>
            You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called
            identifiers, conform to certain rules.

            A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters
            can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through
            "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).

            You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode
            escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and
            _name.
        </p>

                Declaring Variables
            </h2>
        </header>
        <p>
            You can declare a variable in three ways:
            With the keyword var. For example,
            <code>
                var x = 42.
                This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.
            </code>
            By simply assigning it a value. For example,
            x = 42.
            This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this
            variant.

            With the keyword let. For example,
            let y = 13.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section id="Global_Variables" class="main-section">
        <header>
            <h2>Global Variables </h2>

        </header>
        <p>
            Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web pages the global object is window, so
            you can set and access global variables using the window.variable syntax.

            <code>
                var = 10;
            </code>
            Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or frame from another window or frame
            by specifying the window or frame name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is declared in a
            document, you can refer to this variable from an iframe as parent.phoneNumbe
        </p>
    </section>
    <section id="Constants" class="main-section">
        <header>
            <h2> Constants</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
            You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The syntax of a constant identifier is
            the same as for a variable identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and can
            contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.
            <code>
                const PI = 3.14;
            </code>
        </p>
        <p>
            A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while the script is running. It has to
            be initialized to a value.

            The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope variables. If the const keyword is
            omitted, the identifier is assumed to represent a variable.

            You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or variable in the same scope. For example:

            // THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function
            <code>f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS WILL
                CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g; //statements
                }
            </code>
            However, object attributes are not protected, so the following statement is executed without problems.
            <code>
                const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key = "otherValue";
            </code>
        </p>
